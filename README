Ruby version of the Twitter Badge php script.  This script
supports caching of twitter updates to prevent API flooding.

Note, that unlike the PHP version, I have not gotten around
to making the date display pretty.  As time permits, or if
I find a good script written by someone else, I'll implement.

To implement this on your page, simply use the following code.

require 'TwitterBadge.rb'
puts twitterBadge('username', 'password')

This can go inside any Ruby templating you might be using.

Future implementation will include oAUTH as well as database
storage of tweets.
